            1.Document is the object of window property.
            2.You can access it via window.document or document.
            3.When the browser first loads code like this the browser engine reach the html code creates something called a document object model or it otherwise called dom.
            4.Dom is like trees structure that represents the html code of a page.
            5.It is the direct child of the window object. This is also known as Document Object Model(DOM).
            Syntax:
                document.propertyname();
     
    window Object Model:
     
            1.window is the object of the browser.
            2.By default window object is available implicitly in the page

            Syntax:
                window.property_name;
